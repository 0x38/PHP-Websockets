PHP WebSockets
==============

A WebSockets server written in PHP.
-----------------------------------

This project provides the functionality of an RFC-6455 (or Version 13) WebSockets server.  It can be used as a stand-alone server, or as the back-end of a normal HTTP server that is WebSockets aware.

To use:

Do not place the files in your web server's document root -- they are not intended to be ran through CGI.  They are intended to be ran through PHP's Command Line Interface (CLI).

The main class, `WebSocketServer`, is intended to be inherrited by your class, and the methods `connected`, `closed`, and `process` should be overridden.  In fact, they are abstract, so they _must_ be overridden.

Future plans include supporting older draft versions, and allowing child processes forked from the controlling daemon to support broadcasts and to relay data from one socket in a child process to another socket in a separate child proccess.
