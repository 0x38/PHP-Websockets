{"name":"Php-websockets","tagline":"A Websockets server written in PHP.","body":"PHP WebSockets\r\n==============\r\n\r\nA WebSockets server written in PHP.\r\n-----------------------------------\r\n\r\nThis project provides the functionality of an RFC-6455 (or Version 13) WebSockets server.  It can be used as a stand-alone server, or as the back-end of a normal HTTP server that is WebSockets aware.\r\n\r\nIn order to use PHP WebSockets, you must have the ability to arbitrarilly execute scripts, which almost always means having shell access to your server, at a minimum.  It is strongly encouraged that you have the ability to configure your machine's HTTP server.  It is strongly discouraged to allow arbitrary execution of scripts from a web interface, as this is a major security hole.\r\n\r\nTo use:\r\n\r\nDo not place the files in your web server's document root -- they are not intended to be ran through a web browser or otherwise directly accessible to the world.  They are intended to be ran through PHP's Command Line Interface (CLI).\r\n\r\nThe main class, `WebSocketServer`, is intended to be inherited by your class, and the methods `connected`, `closed`, and `process` should be overridden.  In fact, they are abstract, so they _must_ be overridden.\r\n\r\nFuture plans include allowing child processes forked from the controlling daemon to support broadcasts and to relay data from one socket in a child process to another socket in a separate child proccess.\r\n\r\nBrowser Support\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nBroswer Name        Earliest Version\r\n\r\nGoogle Chrome       16\r\n\r\nMozilla Firefox     11\r\n\r\nInternet Explorer   10\r\n\r\nSafari              6\r\n\r\nOpera               12.10\r\n\r\nAndroid Browser     4.4\r\n\r\nNote: Current browser support is available at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket#Browser_support under the RFC-6455 row.\r\n\r\nFor Support\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nRight now, the only support available is in the Github Issues ( https://github.com/ghedipunk/PHP-Websockets/issues ).  Once I reach my $250/mo Patreon reward level, I'll be able to maintain support forums for non-core code issues.  If you'd like to support the project, and bring these forums closer to reality, you can do so at https://www.patreon.com/ghedipunk .\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
